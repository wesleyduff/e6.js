LOW DOWN

To get you started, we included a small index.html file

1) Open the index.html file and open your dev tools and switch to console.

2) on load of the index.html file you will see the console functions fire.

3) Review the main.js file that loads the e6.js library. 

Happy coding!
More to come soon!
